# MyReads Project

This is a project developed as a coding exercise for Udacity's React Nanodegree.
The goal of the project is to adapt the knowledge of React principles: data handling, UI rendering, React Router etc.

## Running the project

In order to run the project, clone it first, then ensure you have node.js installed on your system.

From the terminal execute these two commands: 
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Technologies used to develop the App

The app is developed using React. 
Books are retreived, searched and updated by the BookAPI provided by Udacity.
Navigation is being handled by an external library called `react-router-dom`.
